The Matrix room, IRC channel, Telegram group, and Planet Computers Discord's #general-chat channel are bridged (thanks to the work of Sami Olmari), so all the messages are shared across the three channels.

This list was based heavily on [this topic on OESF](https://www.oesf.org/forum/index.php?topic=36334.0) - thanks Varti!
